            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>West Ham say Andy Carroll is free to leave in the January transfer window</h1><p>West Ham are willing to offload Andy Carroll in the newly opened transfer window. England striker Carroll has regained fitness and form over the festive period, scoring in his last two games. But the Hammers are open to selling their £15million record signing - for £18m - with North East pair ­ Newcastle and ­Sunderland ready to snap the 26-year-old up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9d25d8b2987ff7b75f104e49f6f41bb9686c3cf0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>West Ham's Mauro Zarate and Diego Poyet set for January departures</h1><p>West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has been targeted by Spanish club Malaga. The 28-year-old Argentinian has scored five goals in 20 appearances during his current spell at Upton Park. He is behind Diafra Sakho, currently injured, Andy Carroll and Enner Valencia in the pecking order, however. Zarate's current contract ends in 2017.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ae38c0cff90c3009c1b8d4312d4ea96b26a1911.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ex's Column: Transfer Targets, Lanzini Update, Noble's players. | THE WEST HAM WAY</h1><p>So what a brilliant result that was!! We without doubt deserved the win and I don't think there was a player who didn't play at least a 7 out of 10 game. As I always say, and have done for at least three years, James Collins is a brilliant defender.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9d8312c550adfe8f23fc3436b053540a7f3805f1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Latest from West Ham vs Liverpool</h1><p>Let's just say Jurgen Klopp is NOT a happy bunny this afternoon. He's unhappy with his side's performance. "In the decisive moments, you have to be there" "In a game like this, you have to be better and you have to win". As for Liverpool, they will be thoroughly disappointed with their performance today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b7aa2fa37826549b6d935555258b470e5e22f5ce.jpg"></article>]]></description>
