description: 'West Ham appear to have pipped Everton to the signing of highly-rated Leeds United star Sam Byram, as reported by Sky Sports. It looked as if the Toffees were going to wrap up a deal for the 22-year-old right-back earlier this week, before West Ham entered the running for his services.'
