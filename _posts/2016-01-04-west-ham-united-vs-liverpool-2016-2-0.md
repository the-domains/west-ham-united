West Ham completely outclassed a woeful Liverpool side on the weekend shoring up the double over the scousers for the first time in 52 years.

There was plenty of pushing from both sides, and physically the midfield looked a lot better from Liverpool (or at least the ref was happy to only blow fouls against the Hammers for bumps).

The first goal came from a foul tackle made by Antonio, but to his credit he ran the length of the field to get on the end of a superb cross from Valencia to put us up 1-0 after 10 minutes.

Liverpool hit the bar at the Bobby Moore Lower end with a side foot effort from Emer Cann, but apart from that Adrian kept a comfortable game.

West Ham were unlucky not to put three of four goals past a determined Minolet, although Andy Carroll finally put a great header past him after a well weighted cross from our midfield talisman and Captain Mark Nobel.

It was great to see Payet back on the pitch, and he dazzled the crowd with his crafty footwork and a great through ball which Kouyate was unable to finish off.

Brilliant performance from the whole Hammers team with Ginger Pele, Jame Collins, coming out with a well earned man of the match performance.
